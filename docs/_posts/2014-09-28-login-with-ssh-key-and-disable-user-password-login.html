<p>In this post, I'll tell you, how to create new user in Ubuntu 14.04 and how you disable user password login.</p>
<h2>New user</h2>
<p>Create new user, in my e.g. it's <code>example-user</code>. Set strong password, and fill fields.</p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ sudo adduser example-user
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>SSH key login</h2>
<p>Now you're created new user. In second step, we have to generate new ssh key (if you don't already had it).</p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ ssh-keygen
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And use default value for:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_rsa):
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next we need to copy our ssh key into example-user's authorizies keys file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys).</p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ ssh-copy-id example-user@localhost
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you got next lines, you're permit login to example-user by ssh key.</p>

{% highlight shell %}
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'example-user@localhost'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Disable user password login</h2>
<p>It mean that, you're not longer need password to login <code>example-user</code>. So if we don't any more need password to login our new user, we could disable password login to that user.</p>

{% highlight shell %}
$ sudo usermod -L example-user
{% endhighlight %}
