<p>In this post, I'll tell how you can install Ruby script language on Windows.<br />
This post is made for 64-bits architecture's, but 32-bits is installing mostly same way.</p>
<h2>Download and install</h2>
<p>1. Download Ruby 2.0.0 x64 (http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).<br />
2. Double click Ruby setup icon, and follow setup wizard to forward. HOX! Remember tap on "Add Ruby executables to your PATH".<br />
3. When setup is complete, run next command by command line:</p>
{% highlight shell %}

> ruby -v

{% endhighlight %}
<p>If you got response like: <code>ruby 2.0.0p481</code>, congratulations your Ruby works correctly! If not.. damn, then something went wrong..</p>
<h2>Ruby DevKit</h2>
<p>Ruby could use some native C/C++ extensions, so we need to install Ruby DevKit to get Ruby working as we would like it work.</p>
<p>Download Ruby development kit (http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/), and extract it into Ruby path root (C:\Ruby200-x64\DevKit\).</p>
<p>Run next commands on command line:</p>
{% highlight shell %}

> cd C:\Ruby200-x64\DevKit\
> ruby dk.rb init
> echo -- C:\Ruby200-x64 >> config.yml
> ruby dk.rb install

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now you should are able to run native C/C++ extensions by Ruby.</p>
